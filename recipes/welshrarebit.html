            <li>4 thick slices of Sourdough Bread</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add slices of sour dough to a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in small pot and then stir in flour to create a roux. Allow to cook for about 1 minute, stirring, until the flour gives off a toasty aroma</li>
            <li>Combine the applecidar vinegar and milk, then add liquid to the roux. Stir until thickened then remove from heat</li>
            <li>Add in dijon, sambal olek, and worchestershire sauce. Stir to combine</li>
            <li>Mix in 2/3s of the shredded white cheddar and stir to combine. Then add in the egg and stir to combine</li>
            <li>Spread mixture onto sour dough slices, covering the entire surface up to the crust. Top slices with remaining white cheddar</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, then switch to high broiler if you want to add some darker color to the cheese and crisp up the top (1-2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Optionally top with a little more worchestersire sauce before serving or some pickled jalapenos for additional spice</li>
