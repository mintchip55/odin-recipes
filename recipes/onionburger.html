        <h3 class="inverted">Description</h3>
        <p>This burger was first created during the great depression when hamburger meat was scarce of onions were plentiful. The idea is to create a thin smash burger and to pile as many onions onto the burger as you can.</p>
        <h4 class="inverted">Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>One onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Hamburger</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>American Cheese</li>
            <li>Hamburger Buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="inverted">Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat and begin forming hamburger into balls slighly larger than a golf ball</li>
            <li>Once the pan is throughly heated, take a hamburger ball and smash it into the pan using a flat spatula, a burger press, or any object with a flat surface like a small plate. Sprinkle burger with salt</li>
            <li>Liberally apply sliced onions on top of the burgers so that they are piled high, roughly 1/4 onion per burger</li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes, scrap up the burger from the pan and flip so that the onions are now facing downwards. Add a slice of american cheese on your burger, then add the bottom bun and the top bun on it. This will steam the buns while the burger finishes.</li>
            <li>When the burger is done, normally another minute or two, and the onions have cooked up and carmelized a bit, scoop up the burger and slide the top bun underneath and pull out the spatula, flip rightside up for a completed burger.</li>
        </ol>
